    "one": "The purpose of this game is to defeat the Undead Dragon.\nAs you progress, you will fight enemies, buy swords from the blacksmith, and trade swords that you found in your adventures.\nYou need to have at least one character to play the game and you will also need gold to buy swords. Swords are good. You need swords to fight most monsters. You can get better swords too. Those are pretty awesome. Sometimes you will taste the bitter ashes of defeat, other times you will feel the euphoria of victory. This game is a real emotional rollercoaster.\nYou need swords to fight some monsters, during the game you will experience chilly dying and hot winner emotion."
